# NYC_cabrides_tip_comparison
Analysis and raw data from an analysis to determine if there is a greater ratio of cash tips in the early morning hours (12AM - 3AM) versus the late morning hours (9AM - 12PM).

The purpose of this analysis was to determine if, under likely conditions for employees in the service industry to be taking a cab home (early morning hours, downtown Manhattan where there are lots of restaurants/bars) are more cab fares paid with cash, which is beneficial to the driver. The alternative dataset is taken from the same geographical area but in the late morning hours.

The included PNG file is an approximate visual of the area under study.
